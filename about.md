# 👋🏻 I'm Yeray (pronounced Yer-i-e)

I'm a software engineer living and working in London. I do consultancy helping companies on their Python web stacks where I'm comfortable at any level. I like to think of myself as helpful and not preachy but I do have my opinions about certain things (*cough* testing).

I'm a Python enthusiast but I've delved in other languages like Javascript, Ruby, Objective-C, ActionScript or C# and have some DevOps experience.

I like to write code and about code, usually articles that help people get started on certain technologies or practices that I've struggled or am passionate about. Have look at the [blog](/) or [my Medium page] if you're interested.

You can find me on [Twitter][twitter] or [Github][github] in the links below, or you can [send me an email](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
